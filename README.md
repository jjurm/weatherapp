# Weather App

## Running the app

There are multiple ways to run the app:

- Run `weatherapp.jar`
  
  Required libraries are bundled in the JAR file. 

- Run `./gradlew run` in the terminal
  
  This will download necessary libraries, build the project and run it.

To build the JAR file bundled with all dependencies on your own, run `./gradlew fullJar`, the output is in `./build/libs`
